# You can change these, and soon they will be read and updated

domain: {{.Domain}}
title: {{.Title}}

# To set up a custom URL:
#
# 1. go to the admin area of wherever you manage your domains. If you don't have a domain, buy one (we like dnsimple.com)
# 2. look for your DNS settings
# 3. set up a new CNAME. The host record should be set to whatever your desired subdomain is. Point it at smallvictori.es
# 4. in this file, change "domain: 1234567.smallvictori.es" to your new subdomain (like www.example.com)
# 5. sometimes DNS changes can take a while to propagate so check back later
